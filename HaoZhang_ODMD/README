Per Hao, this example is: 
"An example to demonstrate online dynamic mode decomposition

We take a 2D time varying system given by dx/dt = A(t)x
where x = [x1,x2]', A(t) = [0,w(t);-w(t),0], 
w(t)=1+epsilon*t, epsilon=0.1. The slowly time varying eigenvlaues of A(t)
are pure imaginary, +(1+0.1t)j and -(1+0.1t)j, where j is the imaginary unit."
