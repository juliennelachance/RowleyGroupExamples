# RowleyGroupExamples
A compilation of examples, primarily for testing DMD-based methods. 

To the group: my plan for this week is to collect some of the simpler examples- such as from Jonathan Tu's thesis. 
If the repo gets large enough, we can think about nicer ways to organize everything. 
Later: it would be nice to include visualizations of the data when applicable.
